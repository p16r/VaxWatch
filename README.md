#   VaxWatch

This iOS app uses the [Co-WIN Public API][co-win-public-apis] provided by
[API Setu][api-setu] to browse vaccination centers by district or pincode and
display information and availability of vaccination slots. As mentioned on [API
Setu documentation reference][reference], the appointment availability data that
this app fetches is not live, but from a cache that may be upto 30 minutes old.
Live data is **not** made publicly available for third-party use.
